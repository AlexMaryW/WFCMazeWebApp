# Wave Function Collapse Maze Generator and Solver

Welcome to the Wave Function Collapse Maze Generator and Solver! This project implements a maze generator and solver using the Wave Function Collapse (WFC) algorithm. The WFC algorithm is a procedural content generation technique that can create intricate patterns, such as mazes, based on a set of input constraints.

## Introduction

The Wave Function Collapse (WFC) Maze Generator and Solver uses the WFC algorithm to generate complex and unique mazes. It also includes a solver that can find a path through the generated mazes. The WFC algorithm is known for its ability to create visually appealing and non-repetitive patterns, making it ideal for generating mazes.

## Wave Function Collapse Algorithm

The Wave Function Collapse algorithm is inspired by quantum mechanics and the concept of superposition. Here's a simple explanation:

1. **Superposition**: Imagine each cell in a grid having multiple possible states (like walls or paths in a maze). Initially, each cell can be in any state.

2. **Observation**: You pick a cell and determine its state based on some rules and the states of its neighboring cells. This is similar to observing a quantum particle, collapsing its superposition into a single state.

3. **Propagation**: Once a cell's state is determined, this influences the possible states of its neighboring cells. This propagation continues until all cells have their states determined.

4. **Backtracking**: If a contradiction occurs (where no valid state is possible for a cell), the algorithm backtracks to a previous state and tries a different possibility.

In the context of maze generation, the WFC algorithm ensures that the generated maze is consistent and follows the defined rules, resulting in a coherent and solvable maze.

## Features

- **Maze Generation**: Generate unique and intricate mazes using the WFC algorithm.
- **Maze Solving**: Find a path through the generated mazes.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Adjust the size and complexity of the generated mazes.
