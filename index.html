            <h2>About Wave Function Collapse (WFC) Algorithm</h2>
            <p>
                The Wave Function Collapse algorithm is a fascinating approach
                to procedural generation, originally conceived for creating
                tile-based images but adaptable to various applications,
                including maze generation.
            </p>

            <h3>How it works:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Initial state:</strong> The maze starts as a grid
                    where each cell can be in any state (path or wall).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Observation:</strong> We choose a cell and
                    "collapse" its wave function, deciding whether it's a path
                    or a wall based on predefined rules and probabilities.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Propagation:</strong> This decision affects
                    neighboring cells, limiting their possible states.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Iteration:</strong> We repeat the process, always
                    choosing the cell with the fewest possible states to
                    collapse next.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Completion:</strong> The algorithm continues until
                    all cells have been assigned a definite state.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Advantages for Maze Generation:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Creates more organic, less predictable patterns compared to
                    traditional algorithms.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Can incorporate complex rules and constraints for
                    interesting maze features.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Highly customizable - different rule sets lead to different
                    maze styles.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Guarantees connectedness and solvability when implemented
                    correctly.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                In our implementation, we've adapted WFC to create mazes with
                interesting patterns and guaranteed paths. The algorithm ensures
                that the start and end points are always connected, while
                creating a mix of open areas and intricate passages.
